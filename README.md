# MNIST

## Description
This is a mini-project for implementing a basic Neural Network to recognize the hand-writing image.

## Introduction
1. model.py: It defines the neural network model, which includes two hidden layers and is implemented by pytorch.
2. train.py: It gets the dataset from hugging-face and utilizes Cross Entropy to train the model.
3. test.py: Evaluting the performace of the model by accuracy.
4. mnist.pth: Trained model.
